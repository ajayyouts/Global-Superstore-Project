# Global Superstore Sales Analysis

**Business Impact:** This dashboard transforms raw sales and customer data into actionable insights for strategic decision-making. Key findings include underperforming regions, top customer segments by profitability, and monthly sales volatility trends, helping leadership focus resources where they matter most.

**Tools & Skills:** Excel (Pivot Tables, VLOOKUP, Power Query, Data Cleaning), Tableau (Interactive Dashboards, Filters, Parameters)

## Project Overview

This project analyzes sales data from a global e-commerce retailer to uncover key business insights across customer segments, product categories, geographic markets, and time. Using Excel for data cleaning and exploratory analysis, and Tableau for interactive dashboards, the project answers six business-critical questions that a business analyst might face in a real-world setting.

## Objectives

- Identify the most profitable customer segments and regions
- Analyze product category performance and the impact of discounts on margins
- Evaluate shipping costs and their relationship to profitability
- Uncover sales and profit trends over time
- Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) to support decision-making

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

Before analysis, I performed structured data cleaning in Excel to ensure quality and consistency:
-  Standardized column names and ensured consistency in categorical values  
-  Verified and corrected data types (e.g., formatted order and ship dates)
-  Checked for and removed null or missing values
-  Removed duplicate rows to maintain accuracy
-  Flagged and reviewed outliers (e.g., negative sales, discounts over 100%)
-  Validated the integrity of key metrics like Sales, Profit, and Shipping Cost

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Prior to building dashboards, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase using Excel:
-  Generated descriptive summaries (mean, median, count, min, max)
-  Analyzed segment-level distributions across product and region dimensions
-  Explored time-based trends using month and quarter breakdowns
-  Verified metric stability and uncovered early insights to guide dashboard design

## Tools Used

- **Excel**: Data cleaning, power query, pivot tables, exploratory analysis
- **Tableau**: Calculated fields, visual analytics, KPI indicators, dashboard design

## Business Questions Answered

1. **Customer Segments**
   - Which customer segments generate the highest total profit and highest average order value?

2. **Order Distribution**
   - What is the distribution of customer orders across regions and segments?

3. **Product Profitability**
   - Which product categories and subcategories contribute the most to total profit?

4. **Discount Impact**
   - Which categories have the highest average discount and how do they affect profit margins?

5. **Geographic Profitability**
   - Which regions and countries generate the most profit and what are their average shipping costs?

6. **Temporal Trends**
   - How have monthly and quarterly sales and profit trended over the past two years?

## Dashboards

The Tableau workbook is organized into three dashboards, each aligned with a theme:

## Key Insights

- Consumer and Corporate segments generated the highest profit across most regions.
- The Technology category was the most profitable, while Furniture saw higher discounting and thinner margins.
- The Central Region led in overall profit; North Asia had the highest average shipping cost.
- Sales and profit increased YoY from 2013 to 2014, peaking in Q4, suggesting strong seasonal performance.
- Deep discounts (>20%) negatively correlated with profitability, especially in lower-margin categories.
